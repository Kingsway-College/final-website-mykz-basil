    <p>For the creation of my project.I decided to make a handheld controllable fan because of the upcoming Summer. I wanted to create a fan that is controllable by using a joystick. <br> I watched mulitple youtube shorts to build my idea for this fan, and I finally landed on a youtube channel named TopTechBoy.com. <br>I wanted to create an item that would be useful for the coming summer.<br>Everyone gets hot in the summer  Sun so I decided to create a handheld fan. <br>This fan will be able to sit comfortably in your hand. This fan is good for carrying around Summer. The image below directs you to his website where he puts all his videos, code and instructions for use.   </p>

    <p> I stumbled apon this website while I was looking for ideas to make. <br> This channel is very useful because it gives you instructions of how to wire your Arduino and it gives you the correct codes to use. This website even provides videos for putting together your Arduino, <br> it allows you to learn everything for the step by step understanding. </p>
