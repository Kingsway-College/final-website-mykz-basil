        <p>Using my device is really easy. To turn it on, just push the joystick forward. This will start the device and get it running. <br> When you're done and want to stop it, pull the joystick backward, and the device will turn off. There's also a small red light on the top of the device that helps you know if it's on or off. <br> When the red light is on, that means the device is running.  If the light is off, the device is not on. It’s a simple way to make sure you always know what’s going on with the device. One of the challenges I faced whilst making my device was the wires would always fall out. <br> I even tried to hold down the fan with tape but when I was trying to fix the wires,the tape pulled the whole wires out. So I had to rewire the whole thing. <br> Another challenge was when I was making sure the joystick, lightbulb and DC motor were connected to my project, the DC motor was unable to connect at the bottom. So I had to use tape instead. Something I would use differently would be, possibly using a remote, <br> or using a different type of sticky tack to connecct my fan.
