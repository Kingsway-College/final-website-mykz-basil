        <p>When people play games like Genshin Impact, Fortnite, or Minecraft with the aim of earning money, it often revolves around finding ways to monetize their gameplay or skills. Many gamers see an opportunity to generate income through streaming platforms like Twitch or YouTube, where they can build a following and earn revenue from ads, donations, or subscriptions. For example, Fortnite has a massive esports scene, where skilled players can compete in tournaments for cash prizes. Similarly, Minecraft's vast community of creators allows players to make money by selling custom maps, skins, or mods, or by running servers that attract paying users.
The rise of gaming as a source of income has opened up new opportunities for people to view their hobby not just as entertainment, but as a way to make money, whether through direct competitions, content creation, or by leveraging in-game assets for real-world profits.</p>
